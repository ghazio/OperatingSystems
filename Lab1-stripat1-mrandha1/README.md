[CS 45 Lab1: Shell Redux](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~kwebb/cs45/s20/labs/lab1.html)

The [lab 0 repository](https://github.swarthmore.edu/CS45-s20/Lab0) has an
example file layout and Makefile that shows how you might build all the pieces
together with the included parser.  Please let me know if you have any trouble
-- I'm happy to help you compile and run it.
