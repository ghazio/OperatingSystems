Our policy keeps a track of how many times each page has been accessed
during the entire page history. Each time we have to evict a frame,
we go through all of the valid pages of our page table, and evict the one that
has been accessed the least(lowest count number). We maintain the number of times
a page has been accessed by the system. Each time access function is called onto
it, we increase the count for that particular page.
